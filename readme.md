# Cranch Project
This is the home of the Cranch Project. The Cranch Project is the Council's effort to create the nation's first [UELMA-compliant](documentation/UELMA.md), open-source, state-level Code of Laws.

## What does "Cranch" mean?

William Cranch is known to most American lawyers as the reporter for [*Marbury v. Madison*](http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=19). He was also the Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Circuit Court. But the main reason this project is named after Judge Cranch is that, in 1818, Judge Cranch single-handedly prepared the first code of laws for the District of Columbia. Unlike Judge Cranch, however, the Council plans to use "open-source" tools and practices to prepare the electronic Official Code.

## What needs to be done?

First, the Code needs to be made available in a machine-readable format. For a prototype, see https://github.com/JoshData/dc-code-prototype. Then, we need to make sure that the Code meets [UELMA's requirements](documentation/UELMA.md). Finally, we need to develop a methodology for [updating the Code](documentation/codification_process.md).

## Does this mean that the District is no longer going to publish the hard-bound Code?

No. The Council expects to continue to publish the hard-bound Code under contract. Both, however, could be considered "official" when the Cranch project is complete.
