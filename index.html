<p>This is the home of the Cranch Project. The Cranch Project is the Council's effort to create the nation's first <a href="documentation/UELMA.md">UELMA-compliant</a>, open-source, state-level Code of Laws.</p>

<a name="what-does-cranch-mean" class="anchor" href="#what-does-cranch-mean"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does "Cranch" mean?</h2>

<p>William Cranch is known to most American lawyers as the reporter for <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=19"><em>Marbury v. Madison</em></a>. He was also the Chief Judge of the District of Columbia Circuit Court. But the main reason this project is named after Judge Cranch is that, in 1818, Judge Cranch single-handedly prepared the first code of laws for the District of Columbia. Unlike Judge Cranch, however, the Council plans to use "open-source" tools and practices to prepare the electronic Official Code.</p>

<a name="what-needs-to-be-done" class="anchor" href="#what-needs-to-be-done"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What needs to be done?</h2>

<p>First, the Code needs to be made available in a machine-readable format. For a prototype, see <a href="https://github.com/JoshData/dc-code-prototype">https://github.com/JoshData/dc-code-prototype</a>. Then, we need to make sure that the Code meets <a href="documentation/UELMA.md">UELMA's requirements</a>. Finally, we need to develop a methodology for <a href="documentation/codification_process.md">updating the Code</a>.</p>

<p>No. The Council expects to continue to publish the hard-bound Code under contract. Both, however, could be considered "official" when the Cranch project is complete.</p>    </div> <!-- /container -->        <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
