# The Codification Process Explained

## Background
The Codification Process essentially has 4 stages: 

1. Identification stage, 
2. Disposition stage,
3. Revision stage, and
4. Annotation stage. 
 
Although each stage can be described separately, there is overlap in the processes. Moreover, under current operating circumstances, some aspects of the stages are handled by the vendor and by the Codification Counsel. The Cranch Project contemplates that all stages would be handled by the Codification Counsel.

## Identification Stage
The first stage involves collecting all of the enactments of the Council and determining what acts must be codified. To do this, the Codification Counsel maintains a database of pending and completed legislation. Much of this information currently comes from the Council's LIMS database (title, referral, introduction, first & second reading, act number, act date, law number, law date). But, currently, there is no automatic transfer of information from the Council's main database.

This database is used to generate the Statutes at Large and to generate reports for the Council and for the Office of General Counsel. It also is used at the annotation stage to prepare code annotations.

At the identification stage, the Codification Counsel must determine whether a measure should be codified. For example, freestanding legislation that is temporary in nature is not codified. Emergency and Temporary legislation is typically codified as a note to existing laws. Similarly, resolutions are not codified, with few exceptions (and only in annotations).

## Disposition Stage
The second stage involves identifying which sections of the Code need to be altered. This is done by manually going line-by-line through each measure to determine where changes to the Code must be made. For example, if an act requires that a new chapter be added to the Code, the determination of where to insert the new chapter would occur at the disposition stage. This determination may occur earlier through pre-enrollment discussions with attorneys in the office. Similarly, if an existing section of the Code is amended by an act, that section would be identified at the disposition stage. 
Currently, the Codification Counsel maintains a second database, which maintains records of each change that needs to be made to the Code. Significantly, this database does not *exclusively* contain legislation-initiated records. It may include identified technical errors, references to external actions (such as Mayor's orders, Congressional acts, etc.), and other necessary changes.
The changes that are made to the Code are reflected in a "Code Update Chart," which lists the affected section of the Code, the measure that affects the section, and a description of the necessary change to that section.

## Revision Stage
The third stage involves making changes to the text of the Code itself. At this stage, the Codification Counsel must take--with exacting precision--the language enacted by the Council and incorporate that language into the existing Code. This stage also includes making "conforming" changes, such as changing the phrase "this act" to "this chapter." Similarly, at this stage, references to organic statutes are converted into the applicable Code sections. 

E.g.
> "The provisions of this act shall not be construed to affect the applicability of the Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010, effective April 8, 2011 (D.C. Law 18-371; D.C. Official Code s. 2-351.01 et seq.)." may become "The provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed to affect the applicability of Chapter 3A of Title 2."

## Annotation Stage
At the fourth, and final stage, annotations are made to the Code. Currently, the vendor handles the preparation of most standard annotations, with approval by Codification Counsel. The Codification Counsel inserts various unique annotations where necessary. After the Cranch Project, the annotations would be handled by the Codification Counsel exclusively. The annotation stage has several components, clustered into 5 different types of annotations: 

1. Historical Cite Line;
2. Effect of amendments;
3. Legislative history; 
4. Emergency and Temporary amendments; and 
5. Editor's Notes. 

### Historical Cite Line
If the change to a section is done by a permanent law, the law's information is included in the "Historical Cite Line":

E.g.
> (Oct. 21, 1968, Pub. L. 90-614, title II, § 201, as added Mar. 25, 1977, D.C. Law 1-96, § 2, 23 DCR 9532b; Apr. 27, 2001, D.C. Law 13-283, § 3(a), 48 DCR 1917.)

### Effect of Amendments 
It is the current practice to reflect in the notes the "effect" that a particular law has had on the affected section of the Code. So if, for example, Law 20-42 rewrote a subsection (b) and added a new subsection (c), this annotation might read as follows: 

> "D.C. Law 20-42, rewrote subsec. (b), and added subsec. (c). Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read:
> "(b) XXXX".

### Legislative History of Laws
All permanent acts include a description of the legislative history of the law that amended the section. Sometimes this is done by reference to another section, or is included in the annotation of the section itself.

E.g.
> Law 15-38, the "Streamlining Regulation Act of 2003", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 15-19, which was referred to Committee on Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on June 3, 2003, and July 8, 2003, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on August 11, 2003, it was assigned Act No. 15-146 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 15-38 became effective on October 28, 2003.

> For Law 15-256, see notes following § 2-532.

> Law 15-354, the "Technical Amendments Act of 2004", was introduced in Council and assigned Bill No. 15-1130 which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. The Bill was adopted on first and second readings on December 7, 2004, and December 21, 2004, respectively. Signed by the Mayor on February 9, 2005, it was assigned Act No. 15-770 and transmitted to both Houses of Congress for its review. D.C. Law 15-354 became effective on April 13, 2005. 

### Emergency and Temporary amendments
For non-permanent acts, an annotation is made of any emergency or temporary legislation that affected the section. As part of the Cranch Project, it is part of the desired scope to allow an "overlay" of the Code with emergencies/temporaries, so that a user can see what the Code would look like at any given time (even though the emergency would not be codified in the text, but only as a note).

E.g.
> For temporary (225 day) amendment of section, see § 3 of the Master Business Registration Delay Temporary Act of 2003 (D.C. Law 14-302, May 3, 2003, law notification 50 DCR 3776).

> For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3 of Master Business Registration Delay Emergency Act of 2002 (D.C. Act 14-595, January 7, 2003, 50 DCR 647).

> For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3 of Master Business Registration Delay Congressional Review Emergency Act of 2003 (D.C. Act 15-73, April 16, 2003, 50 DCR 3616).

> For temporary (90 day) amendment of section, see § 3 of Master Business Registration Second Delay Emergency Act of 2003 (D.C. Act 15-83, May 19, 2003, 50 DCR 4100). 

### Editor's Notes
The last category of annotations is a catch-all for annotations that the Codification Counsel deems appropriate for inclusion in the Code. This might include, for example, relevant Mayor's Orders. Or it might include information about sunset/applicability clauses. These tend to be more "customized" for the specific section.
