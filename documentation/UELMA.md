## What is UELMA?
UELMA is an acronym for the "Uniform Electronic Legal Material Act." UELMA is a uniform act adopted by the [Nation Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws](http://www.uniformlaws.org). The act is intended to provide states with

That is, the goals of the authentication and preservation program outlined in the act are to enable end-users to verify the trustworthiness of the legal material they are using and to provide a framework for states to preserve legal material in perpetuity in a manner that allows for permanent access.
