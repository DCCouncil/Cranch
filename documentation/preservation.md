# Preservation

The second requirement for UELMA compliance is preservation. Specifically, [section 7 of the UELMA](/primary_materials/uelma_act.md/#sec7) reads as follows:

```
SECTION 7. PRESERVATION AND SECURITY OF LEGAL MATERIAL IN OFFICIAL ELECTRONIC RECORD. 
(a) An official publisher of legal material in an electronic record that is or was designated as official under Section 4 shall provide for the preservation and security of the record in an electronic form or a form that is not electronic.  
(b) If legal material is preserved under subsection (a) in an electronic record, the official publisher shall:  
	(1) ensure the integrity of the record;  
	(2) provide for backup and disaster recovery of the record; and  
	(3) ensure the continuing usability of the material.
```

On its face, this section imposes two distinct requirements: (1) preservation and (2) security. Moreover, preservation really comprises 3 sub-requirements:

1. Record Integrity
2. Backup and Disaster Recovery
3. Continued Usability[1]



[1]: The third sub-requirement describes continued usability "of the material", while the first two sub-requirements relate to "the record". Literally, this suggests that the first two sub-requirements require preservation of the *file* where the third sub-requirement requires preservation of the *content*. I'm not certain if this was a deliberate choice in language.
